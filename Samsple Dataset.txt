Have you checked if the leg is properly aligned with the table top? Sometimes, it just needs a bit of adjustment.\nCaller: I did check, but I'm not sure how to adjust it. I thought about using shims, but I'm not confident in my skills.\nUser: Shims can work, but if you're not comfortable, you might want to take it to a professional. They can ensure it's fixed properly without causing any damage.\nCaller: That's a good idea. I'll look into finding someone local who can help. Thanks, John!",
